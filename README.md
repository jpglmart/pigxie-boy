## Pigxie Boy: A curly tale
<p>
Pigxie Boy: A curly tale makes the player experience the challenges that a most peculiar
character has to face, in order to find the place where he really belongs. Being among the
“platformer” genre, its mechanics are based on jumping, walking, attacking and dodging
enemies’ attacks. Inspired by classic games, such as Super Mario Bros. and Wonder Boy
The Dragon's Trap, it also features pixel art aesthetics and 2D graphics.
